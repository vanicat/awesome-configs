#+TITLE: Vanicat's awesome config.

My own awesome config.

If you want to use this you will need Emacs's [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. A relatively
recent version will be needed.

You should change ORG_PATH in the Makefile to tell him where org-mode
is.

Modification are probably needed for emacs24, as it already include
org-mode.

Note that this will overwrite the ~/.xsessionrc, so look for any
configuration you might have there.
